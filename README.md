# Project Title

This project is a simple showcase demonstrating the integration of Jenkins, Selenium, TestNG, and Java to automate testing.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate the seamless integration and execution of automated tests using Jenkins, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Java. By setting up Jenkins to execute Selenium tests written in Java using TestNG, we showcase the automation capabilities and how these tools work together to streamline the testing process.

## Tools Used

- **Jenkins**: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables the automation of building, testing, and deploying software.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, allowing the execution of tests across different browsers and platforms.
- **TestNG**: TestNG is a testing framework for Java that facilitates the creation and execution of tests, including support for parallel execution, data-driven testing, and more.
- **Java**: Java is a widely-used programming language, chosen here for its compatibility with Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

## Getting Started

To run the automated tests locally or on your Jenkins server, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK), Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Jenkins installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Setup Jenkins**: Configure Jenkins to pull the project from the repository and execute the test scripts. You may need to install plugins or configure Jenkins agents depending on your setup.
4. **Run the Tests**: Trigger the Jenkins job or execute the test scripts locally to run the automated tests.
5. **Review Results**: Check the test results generated by TestNG or Jenkins to ensure the tests have passed successfully.
